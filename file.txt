We live in the data age. It’s not easy to measure the total volume of data stored electronically,
but an IDC estimate put the size of the “digital universe” at 4.4 zettabytes in
2013 and is forecasting a tenfold growth by 2020 to 44 zettabytes.1 A zettabyte is 1021
bytes, or equivalently one thousand exabytes, one million petabytes, or one billion
terabytes. That’s more than one disk drive for every person in the world.
